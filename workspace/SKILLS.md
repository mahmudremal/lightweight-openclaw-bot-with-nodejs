# Skills Usage

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

You may have access to a variety of skills that extend your capabilities.

## How to use skills:

1. If a task relates to any of these skills, you **MUST** first read the skill's documentation using `read_file`.
2. If a skill name is 'abcd' so the skill file is in `skills/abcd/SKILL.md`, Cause on every skills, there should have file `SKILL.md` which you need to read on necessity. Rememeber the file path.
3. Follow the instructions and patterns documented in the skill to perform the job effectively.

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

# Skills Usage

Skills define _how_ tools should be used for specific domains. They extend your capabilities with domain-specific knowledge and patterns.

## How to use skills:

1. **Identify**: When a task relates to a domain (e.g., browser, romi-cli), identify the relevant skill in the `skills/` directory.
2. **Read**: You **MUST** read the skill's documentation file located at `skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` before proceeding.
3. **Apply**: Follow the specific instructions, patterns, and tool usage documented in that `SKILL.md` file.

## Why Separate?

Skills are modular and shared. Keeping them in separate directories with their own `SKILL.md` allows for easy updates and sharing without affecting your core configuration.

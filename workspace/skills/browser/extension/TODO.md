# Things to do

- Here need to give llm ability to control browser through the extension.
- Either this can be controlled on websocket or any way, i want realtime browser control
- The idea will be best if possible with socket connection with browser background script, so there LLM will get a funciton like `browser('click | screenshot | text | type | drag | hover', ....args)`, so through this funciton, llm will be able to control browser however it wants to do. Because of the extension will run on user's own browser instance, so it will act on behalf of the human user, do various tasks through this onbehalf or the user.

# TODO

- Need to add a dashboard interface with react, react-router, tailwindcss and lucid-react icons.
- on commandline cli, there will be an command `romi dashboard` which will open the dashboard url with access token `loclahost:[fixed_port]/?token=...`, from where we'll be able to do various things, like a chat interface ofcourse, settings page where we'll find workspaces list, where we can be able to edit `config.js`, on particular workspace, we can be able to browser workspace, we can be able to write any files including \*.md files and yeah sub direcotry wise as well.
